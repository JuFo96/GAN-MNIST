## GAN MNIST digit generation
As a simple prototype I want to try and create synthetic handwritten digits, I want to use a GAN (Generative Adversial Network) Architecture. It seems diffusion models perform better, however it also seems like it's harder to implement and possibly harder to train compute wise. 

There should be plenty of data with the MNIST digit dataset.

## Facial creation with emotions
If Mnist works seamlessly, I found another dataset of faces cateogrised by emotion, it could be fun to explore.
